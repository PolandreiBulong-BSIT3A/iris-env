# Iris Flower Prediction App

A simple machine learning application built with Streamlit that predicts Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Features

- Predicts Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)
- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- Uses a Linear Regression model trained on the classic Iris dataset

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - The Streamlit web application
- `train_model.py` - Script to train and save the prediction model
- `iris.csv` - The dataset used for training
- `iris_model.pkl` - The trained machine learning model

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements:
   ```
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
